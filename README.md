Website can be access [here](data-visualizatio-t05-n0a5rqc6d-plehmes-projects.vercel.app).

## Aim
Create a responsive webpage displaying multiple types of D3.js charts based on TV energy consumption data and electricity spot prices.

## Purpose
This exercise builds on previous work with basic bar charts by extending into a **multi-chart dashboard** using D3.js.  
The task demonstrates how to:
- Load and visualise data from multiple CSV sources.
- Implement four different chart types using reusable JavaScript modules.
- Apply good data-visualisation and design principles (layout, readability, and interactivity).

## Technologies Used
- **D3.js v7** – for data-driven document rendering.
- **HTML5 / CSS3** – for layout, typography, and responsive styling.
- **JavaScript (modular)** – for independent chart scripts and shared logic.

## AI declaration
Gen AI have been used to general the index, css, and correct some of the javascript code.
